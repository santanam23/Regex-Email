# Title: Regex Email Breakdown

Hi, thank you for checking out my breakdown of my regex email snippet. Through out this md I will be illustration what code snippet I chose to breakdown. Feel free to go to my github page for any more questions. Enjoy!

## Summary

Regex expressions are commonly used through many progamming languages. It is important to know how to read them and have examples of them in action. I will be summarizing a regex email snippet and showing examples of successful regex tests throughout this breakdown. Below is the code snippet i will be breaking down.
code snippet: ^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/
