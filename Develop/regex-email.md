## Regex Components
The following are regex components used in the code:
*
### Anchors
What is an anchor? Anchors belong to the family of regex tokens that don't match any characters, but that assert something about the string or the matching process. The first anchor that we see is "^" at the beginning of the code.
### Quantifiers

### OR Operator

### Character Classes

### Flags

### Grouping and Capturing

### Bracket Expressions

### Greedy and Lazy Match

### Boundaries

### Back-references

### Look-ahead and Look-behind
